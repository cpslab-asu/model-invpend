# SENPAI FIRE Hackathon

## Inverted Pendulum

This model relies on MATLAB >= 2019b to be installed, along with the optimal
control toolbox. You must also install the `pipenv` command following the
instructions found [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io).

To run the example use the command `pipenv run invpend`. This will ensure
the python environment is configured correctly and then execute the
`cartpole.py` script.
